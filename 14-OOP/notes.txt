Classes:
    A primordial form from which we can create new objects
    Every new object of that class will be an instance of the class

Four fundamental principles of OOP:
→ Abstraction:
    Ignoring or hiding details that don't matter, allowing the user to have an overview perspective of the thing we're implementing
→ Encapsulation
    Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, unaccessible from outisde. This prevents external code from manipulating internal properties/states.
    Some methods can be exposed as public interface (API)
→ Inheritance
    One class inherits the methods/properties of another, and adds up some other ones from itself
    E.g.:
    class user (username/password/email)
    class admin (username/password/email/permissions)
    admin is the child class that inherits the properties of user
Polymorphism
    A child class overwrites a method inherited by the parent class
    e.g.:
    class author: (user/password/email/posts)
    password, different from user and admin, must be 11 characters long and have special characters
