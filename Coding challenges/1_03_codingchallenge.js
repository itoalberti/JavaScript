// Coding Challenge #3

// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times.
// The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the console.
// Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have the same average score)

// 3. Bonus 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher
// score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points.
// Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks
// 4. Bonus 2: Minimum score also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score
// and both have a score greater or equal 100 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

// Test data:
// ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// ยง Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123
// ยง Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106
